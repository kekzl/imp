// Generation configuration, one of the nine sections split out of
// core/dispatch_policy.h on 2026-08-21.
//
// WHY. dispatch_policy.h aggregates all nine and is included by 23 translation
// units, of which 21 touch two sections or fewer. Adding one field to it costs
// 137.1 s of incremental rebuild, against 9.1 s for a small .cpp and 14.6 s for
// the largest .cu the file-size gate polices. A TU that needs only this section
// can include only this header and stop rebuilding when the others change.
//
// This is F-10 one level down, and dispatch_policy.h's own preamble records the
// original: config.h was included by 22 files, 85 TUs transitively, and changed
// 130 times in six months - "the highest build cost in the repo". Lifting nine
// sections into an aggregate fixed that, and gave the aggregate the same
// property for the same reason.
//
// Pure move: the contents below are byte-identical to their previous form, and
// dispatch_policy.h includes every one of these, so no existing include breaks.
